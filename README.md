## Introduction

Hello and welcome to my working environment where I'm using during the duration of Green Fox Academy's bootcamp held in Prague for the first time (Volpes cohort - 17/09/18 through 09/02/2019).

## How to use

The projects/exercises are divided in 17 weeks (represented by the folders week-xx), which are divided in as many folders for each day I worked on projects related to Green Fox Academy.
